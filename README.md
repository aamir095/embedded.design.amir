# Embedded System Design

## IoT Gateway with ESP32

Working with electronics circuits during my undergraduate leads my interest in designing printed circuit boards and embedded circuits. I completed many embedded design projects as a hobbyist and professionally. 

We (Machineer Team) designed the circuit for the Physical IoT Gateway.  It's a device that connects sensors, IoT modules, and smart devices to the cloud. Gateways serve as a wireless access portal to give IoT devices access to the Internet. ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. That's why we chose ESP32 as main processor for the board.
